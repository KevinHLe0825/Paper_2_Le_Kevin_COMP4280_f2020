abstract = {Cloud gaming provides game-on-demand (GoD) services over the Internet cloud. The goal is to achieve faster response time and higher QoS. The video game is rendered remotely on the game cloud and decoded on thin client devices such as a tablet computer or a smartphone. We design a game cloud with a virtualized cluster of CPU/GPU servers at USC GamePipe Laboratory. We enable interactive gaming by taking full advantage of the cloud and local resources for high quality of experience (QoE) gaming.We report some preliminary performance results on game latency and frame rate. We find 109 ~ 131 ms latency in using the game cloud, which is 14 ~ 38 percent lower than 200 ms latency often experienced on a thin local computer. Moreover, the frame rate from the cloud is 25 ~ 35 percent higher than that of using a client computer alone. Base on these results, we anticipate game cloud has a performance gain or QoS improvement of 14 ~ 38 percent against that of using a thin client mobile device. Potential applications of the game cloud for high-performance scientific computing are also discussed in the paper.},

abstract = {State-of-the-art thermal management techniques independently throttle the frequencies of high-performance multi-core CPU and powerful graphics processing units (GPU) on heterogeneous multiprocessor system-on-chips deployed in latest mobile devices. For graphics-intensive gaming applications, this approach is inadequate because both the CPU and the GPU contribute towards the overall application performance (frames per second or FPS) as well as the on-chip temperature. The lack of coordination between CPU and GPU induces recurrent frequency throttling to maintain on-chip temperature below the permissible limit. This leads to significantly degraded application performance and large variation in temperature over time. We propose a control-theory based dynamic thermal management technique that cooperatively scales CPU and GPU frequencies to meet the thermal constraint while achieving high performance for mobile gaming. Experimental results with six popular Android games on a commercial mobile platform show an average 19 performance performance improvement and over 90 percent reduction in temperature variance compared to the original Linux approach.},

abstract = {Since games typically demand considerable computer resources, game players will often purchase new technologies to improve their game performance. One such technology is the solid state drive (SSD) with the potential to provide significantly better performance than the traditional hard disk drive (HDD). However, while the benefits of SSDs to drive access speeds can be demonstrated, the benefits to computer game performance is largely unknown. This paper presents a detailed study comparing the performance of SSDs to HDDs for several popular computer games. Initial experiments provide read access speeds on both a desktop PC and a laptop to provide a baseline for SSD and HDD comparison. Then, detailed experiments are run for three computer games, Civilization IV, Portal 2, and Torchlight, covering a range of disk activity types. Analysis of the results shows SSDs compared with HDDs provide a 25 performance improvement to game boot times and game start times, but no significant improvement to game save times.},

abstract = {Fueled by the maturity of virtualization technology for Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), there is an increasing number of data centers dedicated to GPU-related computation tasks in cloud gaming. However, GPU resource sharing in these applications is usually poor. This stems from the fact that the typical cloud gaming service providers often allocate one GPU exclusively for one game. To achieve the efficiency of computational resource management, there is a demand for cloud computing to employ the multi-task scheduling technologies to improve the utilization of GPU.In this paper, we propose VGRIS, a resource management framework for Virtualized GPU Resource Isolation and Scheduling in cloud gaming. By leveraging the mature GPU paravirtualization architecture, VGRIS resides in the host through library API interception, while the guest OS and the GPU computing applications remain unmodified. In the proposed framework, we implemented three scheduling algorithms in VGRIS for different objectives, i.e., Service Level Agreement (SLA)-aware scheduling, proportional-share scheduling, and hybrid scheduling that mixes the former two. By designing such a scheduling framework, it is possible to handle different kinds of GPU computation tasks for different purposes in cloud gaming. Our experimental results show that each scheduling algorithm can achieve its goals under various workloads.},

abstract = {The video game industry earned 8.85 billion in revenue in 2007, almost as much as movies made at the box office. Much of this revenue was generated by blockbuster titles created by large groups of people. Though large development teams are not unheard of in the software industry, game studios tend to have unique collections of developers. Software engineers make up a relatively small portion of the game development team, while the majority of the team consists of content creators such as artists, musicians, and designers.},
